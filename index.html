      <h3> User Research </h3>
      <p id="description">One of my favorite components of the Design Process is user research. The first part of the double dimond of design allows Product Managers to figure out what the true problem is. 
          It allows me to see users pain points and reactions to everyday issues. By knowing the main deficiencies of a product, our team can solve the correct problem faced by 
          the users. The preliminary user research, such as user interviews, surveys, and diary studies allow us to see preferences of the targeted user group and reveal ways to increase the value of our solution/ product. 
          I enjoy preparing and user surveys and interviews as well as getting feedback from our targeted audience.

        <h3> Ideation </h3>
       <p id="description">The ideation phase allows Ms. Arias and the design team to translate the knowledge acquired during the User Research stage in the design thinking process and create a tangible model. Ms. Arias enjoys working with design teams 
           to brainstorm ideas to create a large pool of solutions that can be filtered and evaluated later. While brainstorming with teams, Ms. Arias uses the I Like, I Wish, What if brainstorming tool that looks at ideas through the 
           lens of the present, the near future, and the distant future. The method allows the team to be creative and think outside the box.

        <img class="skillPics" id="mySkillsPictures"  src="images/userFriendly.jpg">
       <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p id="description">As a Product Manager, Ms. Arias enjoys seeing the results of competitor analysis, and usability tests. Usability, making sure that the product works well is crucial and very important to her. A
          person of average ability and experience must be able to use the product for it's intended purpose easily. When thinking about the use of the teams creation, she focuses on the 5 Quality components: learnability, efficiency, 
          memorability, errors, and satisfaction. </p>
